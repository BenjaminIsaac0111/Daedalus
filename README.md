# Daedalus

Daedalus is a novel dynamic spatial microsimulation prototype being developed at the Leeds Institute for Institute Data Analytics. Currently, the main goal is to a create a proof of concept component as part of the SPENSER (Synthetic Population Estimation and Scenario Projection Model) project.  In this we hope to demonstrate a potential for a highly integrated system that allows users to produce (custom) population projections for policy intervention analysis.
